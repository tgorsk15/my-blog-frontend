This repo represents the Front End of my Full Stack Blog RESTful API project. I built the front end using Vite, React, React Router, JWT Authentication, TinyMCE Cloud, HTML, and CSS.


If you wish to download and use the code yourself, keep in mind there are some dependencies you will have to install with npm:

-jwtDecode
-react-router
-tinyMCE Cloud
